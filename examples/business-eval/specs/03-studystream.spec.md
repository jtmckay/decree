## Problem

Private tutoring costs $40-100/hour and is inaccessible to most families.
Generic study apps don't adapt to individual knowledge gaps — students waste
time reviewing what they already know instead of drilling what they don't.
Teachers can't create individualized practice for every student at scale.
