## Problem

Pet owners spend over $1,400/year on veterinary care, yet most health issues
are detected late because pets can't communicate symptoms. By the time
behavioral changes are noticeable, conditions have often progressed
significantly. There's no easy way for a pet owner to know something is wrong
until it's already serious.

## Solution

A lightweight, waterproof collar with embedded sensors (heart rate, respiratory
rate, temperature, activity) that continuously monitors pet vitals and syncs
to a mobile app. AI analyzes trends to flag early warning signs before they
become emergencies.
