# GreenRoute

## Problem

Last-mile delivery is the most expensive and polluting segment of logistics.
Delivery vans idle in traffic, circle for parking, and face growing
restrictions in urban cores (congestion zones, low-emission zones). Meanwhile
delivery volume keeps climbing with e-commerce growth, and cities are only
getting denser.

## Solution

A network of electric cargo bike couriers operating from small neighborhood
hubs. AI-optimized routing handles package consolidation and dispatch. Each
e-cargo bike covers a ~5 mile radius and carries up to 350 lbs — enough for
most urban deliveries without a van.
