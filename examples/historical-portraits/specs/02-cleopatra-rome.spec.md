# Cleopatra Arriving in Rome

Generate a portrait of Cleopatra VII upon her arrival in Rome in 46 BC,
when she came as Julius Caesar's guest and caused a sensation in Roman society.
She would have been about 23 years old, a polyglot queen ruling the wealthiest
kingdom in the Mediterranean.

  standing at the threshold of Caesar's villa on the Janiculum
- **Lighting**: Warm Mediterranean afternoon light, golden hour
- **Appearance**: Ptolemaic Greek heritage, elaborate Egyptian-Hellenistic
  royal attire, the royal diadem, gold and lapis lazuli jewelry
- **Expression**: Regal composure with sharp intelligence, the diplomat-queen
  arriving in the heart of her ally's empire
- **Details**: Roman architecture in the background, attendants carrying gifts,
  contrast of Egyptian luxury against Roman austerity
