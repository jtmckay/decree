# Lincoln at Gettysburg

Generate a portrait of Abraham Lincoln at the dedication of the Soldiers'
National Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, November 19, 1863. Lincoln
was 54 years old, visibly aged by two years of civil war.

## Visual Direction

- **Style**: Photorealistic wet plate collodion photograph — the dominant
  photographic process of the 1860s. Slightly soft focus, rich tonal range,
  the distinctive look of a glass plate negative
- **Composition**: Head and shoulders or seated three-quarter portrait, as if
  captured by a field photographer at the ceremony
- **Lighting**: Overcast November daylight, flat and even — characteristic of
  outdoor collodion portraits
- **Appearance**: Tall, gaunt, clean-shaven except for his distinctive beard
  without mustache. Dark suit, white shirt, black stovepipe hat nearby or
  held. He wore a wide black mourning band on his hat for his son Willie
- **Expression**: Solemn, weary, but resolute — the weight of 50,000 casualties
  at Gettysburg visible in his deeply lined face
- **Details**: Wooden speaker's platform, crowd in period dress visible in
  background, bare November trees, the cemetery grounds
